<h3>Shoutout to Levin</h3>
<p><small>15th June, 2024</small><br/>
I'm sorry for not writing here in about six months. 
Frankly, not a lot happened during that time. 
I'm still doing decently well at school and work. 
Well, actually, I joined a few clubs in that time. 
The first one I joined was a Jiu Jitzu club. 
Jiu Jitzu is like the predecessor of Karate, Taek Wondo, Thai boxing, and the likes. 
So, if you pull up on me or jump me, and you're alone, prepare to get your ass sent to the hospital. 
No, not really, I'm still cool, just note that I know how to defend myself now. 
Atleast if you were planning on jumping me. 
The second one is a chess club, the oldest one in the world, actually. 
It existed before the first world chess champion was decided. 
Actually, we were taught that before Steinlitz, said world chess champion, everybody used to blunder and gambit and take pieces without reason. 
Kings Gambit? Take. 
I ran out of ideas (I may have developed some sort of dementia during these 6 months) but you probably get the gist. 
If you wouldn't accept gambits or let the opponent take your pieces, you'd be a coward. 
Then Steinlitz came along. 
He was still considered a coward, but a coward who won most of his games. 
The Steinlitz gambit was named after him, kinda ironic considering he didn't gambit as much. 
But it was considered a good gambit, by him anyways. 
So, enough talked about Steinlitz, let's talk about the reason I started writing this, my classmate Levin. 
He calls me names sometimes. 
But names which I think are good, such as Sigma (successful person) and Rizzler (person with charisma). 
The latter one doesn't really suit me, since I wasn't even able to rizz up (use said charisma on) my crush! 
Maybe that will change in the future? 
I don't really know, but stay tuned anyways, you never know. 
Probably not though, my crush probably hates me, she has a lot of reasons to do so, after all. 
I'll stop talking about this topic, otherwise I might say something that I shouldn't say. 
This is <b>the</b> post I am devoting to my classmate, after all. 
He is always, and I really mean ALWAYS, seen hanging with his closest three friends. 
Yet, he seems to have a lot of knowledge on relationships. 
He probably spends his free time reading The Dating Playbook for Men and using the advice from that book. 
And studying, of course. 
Can't make him look bad on the post about him. 
He probably scores better than me on most tests, I forgot what he said his marks were though. 
Oh and also, he likes gaming. 
He showed me a game named Rogue Company. 
It's a game similar to Call of Duty, I guess? 
I don't really know, that's the first shooter I played, apart from some Fortnite at friends houses, and I can tell that those are different games. 
So, back to the topic. 
I believe he uses an HP or a Dell, actually most of my clasmates use an HP or a Dell, or Acer or Asus, I can't distinguish the latter two. 
Actually, two of my classmates use MacBooks, even though it isn't really recommended by the school. 
They seem to be Apple Silicon MacBooks as well, so they don't have the best port selection, although better than immediately before the transition. 
One of them is in Levins friend group, and he says that they have superb battery life and better performance than 3000 buck Windows laptops. 
I believe him, but I think (That wasn't an intentional ThinkPad reference, althouth they're great machines) I'll stick with my Windows install, where I have the possibility to play all steam games without Wine or Proton. 
Not that I do so, I stopped playing video games. 
My dad started giving me 200 bucks for every month so that I stop playing video games. 
I'm noticing that I don't really have a lot more to say about Levin, so I'll stop right there. 
I'm pretty sure this was an amazing read!<br/>
Thanks to Levin for being a good classmate!</p>

<h3>I got a Vlog, I guess</h3>
<p><small>9th October, 2023</small><br/>
I am so sorry for not writing in my blog for over a month.
I didn't have any interest to do so. 
During my break of not writing here, both Autumn (or Fall for y'all american losors) and Spooktober started. 
Another thing that took place is an awkward thing between me and my crush, whose name I probably leaked somewhere on Reddit. 
I think I did it on my alt account though, so no worries, nobody who is reading this is going to know what the name of my crush is (Apart from my personal friends). 
I think the leak was on a post with 1000s and 1000s of comments, so the chances of someone here finding it next to all the other comments there is pretty low. 
I drifted from the original topic, I actually wanted to talk about why I made a YouTube channel. 
The reason has to do with a personal friend whom I haven't asked yet if I can mention him here, so maybe some other time. 
The reason also has to do with the Dating Playbook for Men which told me to get some hobbies. 
Another two books which kinda told me to get better were MontanaBlack 1 and 2. 
Now, I watch some of his streams every now and then. 
Back to topic, I also wanted to ask you all what I should wear for Halloween. 
I will probably make a Video on my new channel for this, since you can actually comment there. 
Since there is nothing else to say, Bye, I guess.<br/>
Thanks to Andrew Ferebee and Marcel Eris (MontanaBlack) for making such inspiring books!</p>

<h3>Sorry for avoiding writing on my blog for so long</h3>
<p><small>6th September, 2023</small><br/>
I am sorry for not writing in here for so long. 
That happened because school and work came in the way. 
By the way, do you know that I made an oldschool subwebsite for work?
Please <a href="https://gauthammu.github.io/oldschool/newindex.html">click here to go to the subwebsite</a>.
Anyway, in the first few days, we needed to do an online english test for evaluating which textbook we should buy. 
I got a 379 from 400, which is equal to a C1 score. 
Nevertheless, the entire class was told to buy the upper intermediate textbook from Oxford, I think. 
It is quite boring compared to the textbook I had before this school. 
At least I could entertain myself with the old one. 
There is too much text in the current one. 
I personally would love to not have anything to do with text, but unfortuately, this page would take too long to load if every blog post was a video. 
And I really hate bad performance scores on webpages. 
That is the reason I was so hesitant of adding an image on my oldschool website in the beginnning, but it turns out that Fontstyles and unnecessary JavaScript take a bigger hit on Performance than Images. 
Actually, all of my oldschool webpages are perfect when it comes to performance, even though there is an animation with my name on the CSS and JavaScript page. 
Please <ahref="https://gauthammu.github.io/contact">tell me what you think about it via the contact page</a>.
Since I have nothing else to do in the moment, I am going to write in this blog, which very few people read, that I am planning to do something with my crush, but that the thing that I am planning to do with my crush is secret, which is true, and then leave. 
Yes I am hobbylos how do you know. 
I guess I am going to tell you that my workplace has a cook from Tamilistan, so that I have something to be thankful for in this post.<br/>
Thanks to the cook of my workplace for making tasty food!</p>

<h3>Sorry for being lazy</h3>
<p><small>22nd August, 2023</small><br/>
As I stated in the title, I am sorry for getting lazy because there were a few things on my mind. 
For example, I randomly got into contact with a random OnlyFans girl on Reddit. 
With getting into contact, I mean that her profile popped up, I looked into it, and like that I got into a Telegram channel where about 20 OF girls post some exclusive content. 
If you don't know what OnlyFans is, I swear to Rhea, don't look it up. 
By the way, did you know that I am Atheist? 
I don't even believe in Rhea. 
With that, I mean the Rhea from greek mythology, not the one from fire emblem or one of the 20 semi-famous people on the Rhea name Wikipedia site or whatever. 
So if your name is Rhea, I am sorry for offending you. 
I find the name pretty timeless and wholehearted, though. 
And yes, I stole that sentence from another website, since I am not able to feel that well. (Coz' Aspergers)
Physical stuff like heat or pain, yes. 
Emotional stuff like love or missing someone, no. 
Actually, in my old school (1-3 Grade) for mentally disabled kids like kids with Autism, ADHD and stuff, my favourite teacher was gone for a while, I think it was maternal leave or something like that. 
When she came back, she asked everyone if we missed her. 
Since I 'lag' a little, as friends say, I am one of the few kids who said no. 
That is actually supposed to be long forgotten, I have no clue why I brought this up. 
Actually, it is quite noticable when I have a crush on someone, that is what friends say. 
In my lifetime, I had a proper crush on 4 people. 
I am not mentioning their names here because I am kinda in an anonym phase. 
I have been talking pretty long about random stuff, so, anyway, I got another post on Reddit approaching 400 karma, this time on deutschememes. 
It was kind of a 'I will send the top post to my crush' thing, except that I actually sent it, which if I think about it, is probably not what I should have done. 
If you use Reddit, please Contact on Telegram. 
I check it way more often now because of that Fanspace channel with those OF girls I talked about earlier. 
Anyway, the top comment was (translated): 'give me the Number of your Sister', which would be fine, if she would not be 10 Years old, or 5 Years younger than me. 
If you want, you can look at and understand <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deutschememes/comments/15xbw1e/solange_es_mehr_als_20_upvotes_hat/">the post</a> yourself, unless you use a really crappy translator. 
But as long you use either a native speaker of German or DeepL translator, you should be fine. 
Unless the Landeskriminalamt knoks on your door, then you are not fine if you used the former option of translating the page. 
This post is getting long, so toodles!<br/>
Thanks to my mother for reminding me to post!</p>

<h3>Lets talk about Trains in Switzerland</h3>
<p><small>15th August, 2023</small><br/>
I got this idea when I saw a table on Wikipedia about train networks, so I am writing about trains in Switzerlshe asked everyone and. 
While Switzerland has 5,317 kilometres of train tracks, or 37th place in global comparison, we got it all electrified, which means that we, along with Armenia, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore, Qatar, Mauritius, Puerto Rico, Macau, Liechtenstein and Monaco, are the ones with the most electrified railway network. 
But it is much harder to electrify 5,000 kilometres rather than less than 500. 
We also have only 7.76 square km per route km (lower is better), which is 7th place in global comparison, or 1,631 people per route km (again, lower is better), which is 23rd in global comparison. 
We peaked at 5,632 km of tracks, which is 19th in the world, and the majority of the current tracks are nationalized, but not all of it. 
All of that data is fairly recent as well, being only 3 years old. 
That is all you need to know about railways in Switzerland. <br/> 
Thanks to Switzerland for having such an amazing railway network!</p>

<h3>Started my apprenticeship today!</h3>
<p><small>14th August, 2023</small><br/>
Yes, I started my apprenticeship today. 
It feels great, but I was caught gaming on their computer, even though I already finished the task given to me. 
That bit feels kinda bad. 
But one big perk of working there is the free lunch. 
We ate Spaghetti today. 
One of my fellow pupils has a YouTube channel named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CV_19.">CV 19</a>. 
He makes Formula 1 content. 
I mean the kind in racing games, not the in real life versions. 
If you like that kind of content, please make him happy. 
I was not sponsored by him or anything, I just find his content nice, and you probably will, too. <br/> 
Thanks to my new colleague for having a F1 YouTube channel!</p>

<h3>Today was not the best day...</h3>
<p><small>12th August, 2023</small><br/>
Today morning, I did a Via Ferrata with my father and a friend of his, which I don't like to do. 
On top of that, I was not allowed to use my phone on the car ride back because my father was angry because I walked while playing Stumble Guys on my phone. 
Then, the plans to go to the street parade got cancelled. 
I do not know why, but a friend could not go or something, I guess. 
The only upside about today was the nice chat I had with my old class teacher over the phone. 
We talked about stuff you talk with your old teacher about, like where he works now, for example. 
Or about my apprenticeship. 
And other stuff I forgot. <br/> 
Thanks to my old teacher for talking to me for 25 minutes!</p>

<h3>Excited for Street Parade tomorrow!</h3>
<p><small>11th August, 2023</small><br/>
As I said, I will be going to the Street Parade in Zurich tomorrow. 
<br/> 
Thanks to the Street Parade for getting organized!</p>

<h3>I got a girl!</h3>
<p><small>10th August, 2023</small><br/>
Yes, it is true, I am chatting with a girl on Snapchat in the moment!
She is absolutely gorgeous, almost too beautiful. 
She looks like an Instagram filter, to be honest. 
I think that she would like to meet me in real life. 
But I am not sure. <br/> 
Thanks to the girl whom I am writing with on Snapchat for writing with me!</p>

<h3>I am famous!</h3>
<p><small>8th August, 2023</small><br/>
I am famous, guys and girls! 
Why I am saying that? 
That is because I made a runner-up post in Reddit!
But you might say, But Gautham, there is not any post of you in the entirety of reddit! 
Well, that is my old account. 
My new account, u/Thisismyredusername, hit the home run in r/ChatGPT. 
And that is just because I posted about its ability to speak very swollen language. 
But look for yourself: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/15le89n/wanna_know_what_happened_after_that/ 
I got 286 upvotes with an upvote rate of 93 percent, 216 thousand views, 295 community karma with 96 comments and the post was shared 164 times. 
In fact, it changes every sentence I write here. 
But you may not know what these metrics mean. 
Well, upvotes are number of people who upvote minus number of people who downvote. 
Upvote rate is percentage of upvoters in amout of people who interact with the votes. 
The views are the amount of times the post is displayed to people. 
Community karma comes when people interact on your post in the comment section and shares are the times the link is shared on WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, whatever. 
You actually only see the upvote counter and the comments, everyting else is only visible to the poster, who is me. 
I hope you understand how Reddit works now. <br/> 
Thanks to everybody who upvoted, interacted in the comment section and shared my post on Reddit!</p>

<h3>Sorry for missing a day</h3>
<p><small>7th August, 2023</small><br/>
I am really sorry for breaking my habit of writing here every day in the summer holidays. 
But that is because I simply did not have any time yesterday, because it was so busy for me. 
A few friends finally had time to hang out with me and my brother, Saketh. 
One of those friends is in an appereticeship at the company which makes the most used browser (if you know what I mean) and therefore a Noogler. 
Don't you find that interesting as well? 
Anyway, we went swimming in the local swimming pool. 
The entry price has skyrocketed to 6.50 for up to 15 Year olds, and to 9.50 for people who are older. 
That is the exception though. 
Since I do not have permission to share what other thing I want to share, I need to say goodbye now. 
But before I do that, I want to tell you about the garden of my parents. 
I actually just went and watered the tomatoes there. 
We grow beans, tomatoes, a few very big pumpkins, two varieties of zucchinis, bottle guards, bitter guards, ridge guards, cucumbers, chilis, koriander, salad, spinach, mint, grapes, aubergines, yellow cucumbers, amaranth... okay we need to stop now. 
Now I want to say goodbye. <br/>
Thanks to my friends for hanging out with me and my brother! </p>

<h3>General interests of mine</h3>
<p><small>5th August, 2023</small><br/>
The things I am interested in are Nothing. 
With Nothing, I mean the smartphone company, Nothing Technology Ltd. 
They make smartphones which stand out, due to the LEDs on the back. 
But that is not the smartphone I would buy. 
The smartphone I would buy is the Fairphone 4, since it is mostly from recycled materials. 
And you can replace parts of it as you like and/or need. 
Do you know in what else you can change the parts? 
The Framework laptop 13. 
It is not recycled, but you can replace parts of it to make the usage period longer. 
You can also do that with the Insta360 One RS. 
As you see, I love modularity. 
But there are also other things that I love, like a good set of friends. 
I have a pretty good friend, who is called David. 
He does not want you to know what we did yesterday for an hour, but you may be able to guess it. 
When I asked him, he said, No, Never. 
Since I cannot write anymore about him without breaking the agreement which we 'signed' with  a handshake emoji on WhatsApp, I need to end this post here.<br/>
Thanks to modular tech companies for making amazing tech!</p>

<h3>Thought cords!</h3>
<p><small>4th August, 2023</small><br/>
Here are two more thought cords which I wrote. 
Do note that they are more like blog posts ahead of time now, instead of going from one thing to another like last time.
<ul>
<li>   This is my second thought cord. 
I am pretty bored. 
My brother is watching a Telugu (our mothertongue) movie. 
I don't know that language. 
I forgot it over the time, because I don't use it that much. 
I wish I had a YouTube channel. 
But it seems like I have a Google Educations account, because I cannot make a YouTube channel. 
I have written about 350 characters until now. 
That is very surprising for me. 
I just made a writing mistake, which is also called a typo, and I went back and fixed it. 
For some reason I am thinking about TikTok, about my very cringe first channel, ilovetiktokv, and about my second channel, gauthammudunuru, which, although it has matured compared to my first account, is still cringe. 
I always got low views on the videos I made. 
Maybe that is because I am a (variation of the n-word). 
Yes, I was told that in the comment section of one of my videos on my second channel. 
No, I don't care if I get cancelled because I am a bad boy. 
My crush said that she likes bad boys. 
Well, guess what, (b-word), I am bad. 
Oh man, just got another typo. 
Guess I am also bad in typing. 
I guess that is because I have been doing this for on and off about 3 weeks. 
On 1 week, off 2 weeks. That 2 week break was because of the summer camp, which is called Sommerlager in German, or Sola for short. 
Now I have written about 1350 characters. 
I think that that is crazy. 
But I want to get this to 2000 or atleast 1500. 
So, what else is there to talk or write about? 
Ah, I know, the Reddragon 8s Pro or something. 
Wait here, I need to check if I wrote the name correctly. 
(After checking) Nope, it is called the Red Magic 8s Pro. 
My brother just asked me, if I am hungry. 
I said no, since I am not hungry at the moment. 
I am just thirsty, I want a glass of ice water. 
I'll be back after giving myself that. 
(After getting ice water) I'm back. 
I also used the oppertunity to go to pee and weigh myself on the scale. 
My weight is currently 59,6 kilos. 
If any of you are american, (f-word) you. 
Goodbye</li>
<li>I am now writing my third thought cord, just an hour or two after the second one. 
I am so bored, so writing another thought cord today helps me as much as reading this blog post. 
So please keep reading. 
My brother is watching a movie called Baerenbrueder in the moment. 
I am not enjoying the movies he is watching, Baerenbrueder is very childish in my opinion. 
I am trying to write while this movie is running. 
I really cannot concentrate while he is watching. 
Anyway, I want to tell you that I have already written more than 500 characters, which is amazing! 
And now it is 550! 
But back to the thought cord. 
If you are wondering what tool I am using right now, I am using the Editor in Windows 11. 
I searched for Notepad, but Editor popped up first. 
Now I have used it to write two and a half thought cords. 
Oh man, this movie, Baerenbrueder, is being so annoying right now. 
If you want to know what I mean, then watch it, but I don't advise it. 
It is too annoying and childish. 
Do you know what else is annoying? 
My crush, who did not say something to my since she told me that I should delete 2/5ths of 30 July's blog post. 
Atleast I think that it was from the 30th July. 
I cannot check in the moment, since I am in Editor. 
(After checking what rang) I heard an Alarm and whent to check what it was. 
It was an alarm in both of my phones, a Samsung Galaxy A 05 and a Samsung Galaxy S 21. 
I am in the switching process and my alarms are among the things being switched. 
I also took the time to quickly reconnect with an old school friend, Tiago. 
I think that we were in the same school for 3 years, 9-6 years ago. 
Yes, I switched those digits around, since those would otherwise make a pretty cringe number, if you know what I mean. 
But it is a number I would love to recreate with my crush. 
For some reason, I remember some random pickup-line, which goes like this: You are like a magnet, because your eyes attract mine. 
If you are reading this, please share if you would go on a date with me after telling you this pickup-line. 
If not, I will assume that you did not read my blog and may cut you off. 
I am joking, but I will be sad if people do not read my blog, do you understand? 
But if I want people to read my blog, I should probably share it.
Bye</li></ul>
That is all I have to say, except for the fact that I added place of residence to my website.<br/>
Thanks to myself for writing this blog (and possibly monetizing in the future?)!</p>

<h3>Quick infos</h3>
<p><small>3rd August, 2023</small><br/>
It is time to introduce quick infos, a means of sharing multiple bits of quick information in one blog post because A. A blog post with only theme is boring and B. Because I have multiple things to share with you today. 
The quick infos are in no specific order. 
<ul>
<li>Sankar was too busy to meet up yesterday, but he shared that info only with my brother, but not with me. 
So I left to go to his house, but then I found out that he cancelled.</li>
<li>I have set up a Telegram to communicate with you. 
Even though I may not look at it often, I will look at it since it will not drown in my spam emails.</li>
<li>I and my brother are fasting to lose weight. 
But the main reason is to remove bad cells in our bodies, which will be eaten by good cells instead of food.</li>
<li>Here is a small thought cord I wrote: I am typing this because A. I am bored and B. I need to learn touch typing in two weeks. 
I and my family are watching Sherlock Holmes right now, and I am just realizing that he may be an Asperger. 
Just think about it, he is different from everybody else. 
Although, he may also be ADHD or ADD. 
I have a friend in the Jubla who has that condition, a pole. 
Poles are the only people in the world who call tea anything close to herbata. 
Tea is enjoyed most in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is long for UK. 
The UK is a country with countries in it, called a constituent country. 
The Netherlands is also a constituent country. 
The Netherlands are one of the most bike-friendliest countries in the world. 
But Denmark is even bike-friendlier in my opinion. 
Denmark is also one of only two countries bordering Canada, the other one being the USA. 
What comes to mind when thinking about the US? 
Guns and fat people? 
Then you are really similar to me. 
Switzerland also has pretty high gun ownership rates.</li>
</ul>So, I geuss that those quick infos are all I have to say.<br/>
Thanks to my mother for suggesting fasting!</p>

<h3>The boredom of the summer holidays</h3>
<p><small>2st August, 2023</small><br/>
Since I am in the summer holidays and I am so bored, I decided to type a blog post. 
My brother is watching an old CD version of Sherlock Holmes next to me, but I hate that series. 
Well actually, the series is set in the 2000s, unlike other Sherlock Holmes media. 
So it is actually the newest. 
I recognised that it is from the 2000s because an iPhone playes a small role in the series. 
Wait, so then it is possibly from the 2010s.
But it does not matter, because I hate that series. 
Even though I am looking forward to go to meet up with a frîend named Sankar, I am bored in the moment. 
Or I can think about my possible depression, which, if I have one, was caused by my crush not liking or possibly hating me. 
I do not know where sadness ends and depression begins. 
What do you, the reader of this blog post, think? 
Do you think that I am depressed or not? 
I wish I had a form of contacting myself other than that stupid contact form. 
I guess I could set up a Telegram. 
Well, there is a lot of time to do that now. 
I will probably write here tomorrow.<br/>
Thanks to my friend, Sankar, for meeting up with me later this day!</p>

<h3>Happy 1st August!</h3>
<p><small>1st August, 2023</small><br/>
Ah yes, the day with fireworks, a lot of swiss flags and Coop with their 1st-August-Weggli (Or other name if you are not swiss german). 
Atleast if you are in Switzerland. 
You may ignore this post if you are not in Switzerland. 
Or not, because I need readers. 
Anyway, there are a lot of things happening in Switzerland right now. 
Like a fire on a mountain? 
Okay, Nidwalden, did not expect that, but okay. 
And also a celebration on the Rütli! 
Even though it is not official, the bundespraesident holds a speech, which is broadcasted in the radio, TV, and YouTube. 
Do other countries also have celebrations like that? 
Please write it to me via the contact page of this web appearance or, if you have my phone number, which is very likely if you are reading this, via WhatsApp. 
Maybe I will set up a Telegram account for contacting me. 
But lets move on to the next topic, because I have one. 
As you can see in the blog post below, I have written about my crush and the details I have written were too personal. 
I apologise for the mistake I made, which resulted in personal data being shown on this website without consent. 
And I also apologise for not making the apology sound like a real apology. <br/>
I made an apology in this blog post!</p>

<h3>Sorry for not writing for a long time!</h3>
<p><small>30th July, 2023</small><br/>
As I wrote in the title of this blog post, I am really sorry for not writing for a really long time. 
Because I haven't written in a really long time, there are a few things that have changed. 
I stopped playing drums for example, and I also am in the process of learning touch typing. 
I am able to type with 10 fingers, as I am doing right now, but it is a great difficulty to not look at the keyboard while typing. 
I need to learn touch typing for the job school I will visit, this typing style is a half of the reason I am writing this post. 
The other reason is the huge crush I have developed. 
As you may or may not know, I am a part of the Jubla Seebach. 
Speaking of the Jubla, it is reminding me of the updates I need to do to my group's website. 
(After making the updates) So, I went and updated that website. 
But you may not know what Jubla is. 
Well, it is an Organisation like boys/girls scout. 
There are group hours (every or every second weekend) and camps and whatnot. 
There is a pentecost camp, a summer camp and a christmas camp. 
I just came back from the summer camp yesterday or the day before yesterday. 
That camp is the longest of the three and the one with the most happening in it.
(The next day, because I was too tired to countinue writing) Many games for example, like <a href="https://de.scoutwiki.org/Bulldogge">Saubulldogge</a> (in German, sorry) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag">Capture the Flag</a>, are played during the camp. 
There are also the KiRe-Tag, a day where the group leaders behave like the peskiest, most annoying infants ever to test if the oldest group would be good enough as group leaders. 
Or the Gruppetag, where every group does its own thing, like on a normal Saturday. 
Or, the most relevant Day for this long Story, the Schlussabig, where everybody gets "married" to another person for the evening. 
If it isn't obvious, I wanted to get married to my crush (not mentioned because anonymity, but all names known to author). 
I dont know why I got this crush on her.
(big removed part because she doesn't want others to know this stuff)<!-- She ended up marrying a different guy, who she likes. 
I got married with a different girl, who likes me because I am nice to her, but I try to be nice to all girls. 
Yes I am a simp how do you know. 
Anyway, I do not think that you can guess what happend at the dinner table at Schlussabig. 
We were all sitting pretty close, like every other dinner in the camp with the sole difference that the person you are married to needs to sit opposite to you, probably to maximise eye contact if you are looking straight. 
The girl I was married to was sitting next to my crush, which meant that I sat next to the guy my crush was married to. 
At that evening, the girl I was married to whispered to my crush, whose "husband" wasnt that nice to her since he did not really know what to talk with her about, that I was nice to her. 
My crush said that I am a nice guy, but I did not really hear that bit. 
The girl I was married to repeated it, I asked from whom that compliment came, she said from my crush. 
After that, I said, "You are saying that compliment to the wrong person, since A. You are not married to me, and B. The person you are married to is much nicer than I am." -->
I really do not know what to say anymore, this post is getting long after all. 
I just want to say that my group supported me whenever my crush said that she disliked me.<br/>
Thanks to my group for supporting me!</p>

<h3>Happy Easter Saturday!</h3>
<p><small>8th April, 2023</small><br/>
In the morning, I helped in clearing some clutter in the trophy wardrobe at home. 
Then, I met with my friend Yassin. 
I wanted him to come to my house tomorrow and sleep over, which he also wanted, but he had too many friends who wanted to visit him to do so. 
But still, we had a lot of fun in the three hours we were together. 
And then I needed to leave to get a haircut. 
Now, my hair is only three millimetres long. 
I wanted to grow my hair, though. 
So, that is all I did today. 
I hope you like what I do on extended weekends.<br/>

<h3>Landed about five bottle flips today</h3>
<p><small>5th April, 2023</small><br/>
Do you know what a bottle flip is?
If not, ask sombody else or let me explain. 
You hold the bottle by the lid section and then try to flip it. 
It needs to land and stay upright for it to count. 
I never knew how to do one, until now. 
Once you are able to do one, many more will follow. 
But I bet you cannot film a bottle flip trickshot and post it online. 
I would honestly like to see you try. 
Look up from the device you are reading this blog post on, grab a water bottle and try to do one. 
Come on, do not be shy. 
And do not under any cicumstances forget to record it. 
I promise that it will lead to Likes, Shares and Subscribes.<br/>

<h3>Shoutout to my 3D-designing friend Ron!</h3>
<p><small>4th April, 2023</small><br/>
Recently, I found out that my friend Ron is a pro in 3D-designing. 
I found out, when he showed me one of his models. 
It was a red dragon, a very cool one. 
Actually, when I helped him free it from the supports, I accidentally chopped off its head with the awl.
But we quickly fixed it by soldering the head back onto the body. 
He even agreed to making some awesome 3D-models for his friends, including me. 
A model of a Porsche, a small fidget toy and a cube with my logo engraved in it. 
He designs stuff for everybody. 
Here is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/3d_drucker_erstellen_/">his instagram</a>, if you want him to make stuff for you. 
That is also where you can see his flagship designs.<br/>

<h3>About the new Framework Laptops</h3>
<p><small>1st April, 2023</small><br/>
Since I recently joined the Framework Developer Program, they asked me, if I preferred Intel or AMD, and sent a Framework Laptop 13 Motherboard with an Intel 13th Gen CPU my way. 
But let me first tell you what Framework actually is. 
It is a company which makes laptops, which are modular. 
It means that you can replace parts in the laptop by yourself with just one or two tools. 
The company sells replacement parts in the so-called Framework Market Place, including the mainboards of their new laptops. 
That is what they sent my way. 
Since I need seperate RAM and a seperate SSD to use it, but I do not have any, I unfortunately cannot use the Mainboard yet. 
I think that I will get everything from the Framework Marketplace. 
I was actually planning on getting a Framework Laptop, but now I do not have to get one at all.<br/>
The last thing I need to say is that I wish everybody who believed this blog post a happy April Fools Day!</p>

<h3>What I think about Keyboard Sizes</h3>
<p><small>26th March, 2023</small><br/>
There are many keyboard sizes, and I will cover then here and say what I think about them.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Fullsize (100 %)</dt>
<dd>Many people use them, especially people who have to work with Excel, because it is one of only two keyboard sizes with a numberpad on the side. 
It is a great keyboard size for people with large desks. 
But if you need a little more space for your mouse, you should use a ...</dd>
<dt>Compact 1800 (96 %)</dt>
<dd>You never see one, except in big old HP laptops. 
I think that Keychron also makes one. 
Keychron makes keyboards in all sizes, as long as all keys are smushed together. 
Compact 1800s are normal sized keyboards, except they are less wide and omit a key compared to Full Sized. 
But if you do not need a bunch of keys which are supposed to be a numberpad, you should buy a ...</dd>
<dt>Tenkeyless (TKL)</dt>
<dd>Now, there is no numberpad, but everything else is like on a Full Size keyboard. 
You have a lot more space to use your mouse. 
But if you need more space for your mouse, you should go to ...</dd>
<dt>75 %</dt>
<dd>Now you got even more space for your mouse, which is achieved by smuching the keys together. 
But maybe you need space for your coffee mug and are willing to drop the keys from F1 to F12 for that. 
Then you should switch to ...</dd>
<dt>65 %</dt>
<dd>Done. 
There are no F row keys. 
You would be a monster if you would go even further. 
But if you are a monster, I may write about even smaller keyboard sizes the next time. </dd>

<h3>Do not do the Mistake I made</h3>
<p><small>24th March, 2023</small><br/>
Now, my macro pad is ready and the keys finalized. 
If it were not like that, however, I would be pretty screwed. 
Here is why. 
Let me tell you about a YouTube video, which was also about a macro pad. 
In the video, he made a boot.py file on his microprocessor, in which he disabled the ability of it to store data, causing that annoying popup which appears when an USB drive is attached to not appear anymore. 
I, not knowing what problems it would cause, followed his advice. 
Big mistake, because I was not able to edit the firmware on my pico after that. 
So, if are going to make a macropad in the future, or if you are finalizing the firmware, do not even think about making a boot.py file because it will make many more probalems than it will solve.<br/>
Thanks to Make'n'Modify for making a flawed, yet otherwise cool video!</p>

<h3>My second macro pad</h3>
<p><small>22nd March, 2023</small><br/>
I got the chance to show the macropad I made in school to my drums teacher and he wanted one for himself, but with only three keys instead of nine. 
Since I got some leftover switches and key caps from the first macro pad, I only need a new Raspberry Pi Pico to start working on my second macro pad, which I will sell to my drums teacher for the low price of 30 Francs. 
We already know what I should program onto the buttons, which are the macros for Start/Stop and Record in his music editing applicion, and maybe Fasting Forward in YouTube. 
By sheer coincidence, the beginning letters of those macros make up the name of a swiss radio and tv station, SRF. 
It is not hard to see where the letters in the name of the station come from. 
Got to go, so bye and sowry for not posting in the last few days!<br/>

<h3>Holy Cow!</h3>
<p><small>20th March, 2023</small><br/>
What did you think about when you read the title of this blog post? 
If you thought about the burger restaurant chain, you would be guessing the topic of the post. 
The one with the 25 Franc meal and free ice tea refills and actually good fries compared to the likes of McDonalds, Burger King and KFC. 
It is a rather small chain, with about ten to fifteen locations. 
That is why I did not know about it at all. 
But it is really good and there are a lot of really good fries in the menu. 
We all had stomach ache after eating the meal. 
With we, I mean my group from Jubla. 
We went there today. 
My only complaint with the restaurant is that there are two locations side by side, which really is not necessary at all. 
And the ice tea is not perfect, but it is decent. 
If I were a food inspector, I would give it a 9 out of 10.<br/>

<h3>Happy Global Recycling Day!</h3>
<p><small>18th March, 2023</small><br/>
Today, I am happy to announce that I will be participating in the Global Recycling Day by recycling two plastic bottles. 
I wanted to do a little more than just that, but I cannot find how to participate in the local recycling event. 
I also answered a quiz about recycling to participate in a giveaway for two tickets for the Verkehrshaus in Lucerne. 
But those are only things I am doing today which are about recycling. 
In the last two days, I have been very busy with school work and my macro pad. 
I have been thinking about extending it to 25 keys instead of 9, but it is not possible in the moment. 
It is actually possible since the Raspberry Pi Pico has 28 GPIO Pins, but not within the week I have to submit it. 
But then, it would be a number pad, not a macro pad. 
There is already a person who built a 25 key macro pad, and he is a very small YouTuber with two Followers who goes by the name the key guy. 
The key in keyboard, not the key which opens doors. 
Maybe I will make one, maybe not.<br/>

<h3>My very own budget macro pad (and other stuff)</h3>
<p><small>15th March, 2023</small><br/>
If you do not know yet, I had to choose a project to do for school because I am in my last school year. 
I chose to make a homebrew budget macro pad which is comparable in price with an Elgato Stream Deck mini, but with nine keys instead of six. 
But being the procrastinator that I am, I chose not to work on it until two weeks before the deadline. 
I pushed myself really hard to write the handicraft teacher for help with soldering the swithes to my Raspberry Pi Pico. 
Being the fan of soldering stuff that he is, he agreed to help me and we managed to get the macro pad working. 
It took us a really long time to figure out that the switches were named from top to bottom instead of left to right. 
Now, it can control the text cursor and trigger stuff like the Delete key. 
You can find the tutorial I used on <a src="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-build-macro-pad-on-budget/">make use of</a>. 
Please check it out. 
In the title of the blog post, I wrote that there is some other stuff I need to tell you. 
That other stuff is the parent teacher conference I just had. 
Now, because I have concentration problems, I need to look for an image which asks me if had done everything I need to do in the school. 
If the answer is yes, I need to finish everything I need to do for school before I can ask my teacher if I can do something else, like chess. 
I need to put the image on a new webpage and set it as the default page in safari. 
I will probably use the pic from the "Let me do it for you" meme. 
Now you know a little more about me.<br/>

<h3>Sowry for not writing a blog post yesterday</h3>
<p><small>14th March, 2023</small><br/>
As you can probably tell, I did not write a blog post yesterday. 
I just forgot to do it somehow. 
But you may wonder, how I write a blog post. 
While other bloggers are using online interfaces where they do not have to look at the code of the website at all, I use a different approach. 
As you can tell from looking at the adress bar, I use Github Pages to store my website, and I edit it the same way other programmers edit their code projects: through the online Github editor. 
So, to add a blog post to my website, I open this webpage in Github, click on the button which says "Edit in Place", and then add the post by typing it. 
But there are a few rare cases when I forget to do that. 
If that happens for one day, do not panic. 
That means that I just forgot it or that I decided to write it at night. 
However, you can panic if I do not write anything on a second day. 
That means that I am either very busy or that I am not present. 
It only happened once, which was when I was very busy for four days with friends after my skiing camp. 
Got to go now!<br/>
Thanks to the handicraft teacher for helping me with a school project!</p>

<h3>Raspberry Pi 3 A+</h3>
<p><small>12th March, 2023</small><br/>
As you may or may not know, I am interested in Raspberry Pis. 
They are fascinating since you can use them as normal computers. 
In the future, I want to use one of them as my PC. 
But the newest one, the Raspberry Pi 4 B, is pretty hard to find. 
That is why I have looked at the previous models, such as the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and the Raspberry Pi 3 A+. 
The differences between the models are size, ports and amount of Random Access Memory, or RAM for short. 
While the 3 B+ has four USB ports, an ethernet port and 1024 Megabytes of RAM, the 3 A+ only has one USB port, no ethernet and 512 Megabytes, which is half the amont of RAM. 
This makes the Raspberry Pi 3 A+ cheaper and a little less tall, which makes it better for some projects. 
Take Carter Hurds <sup><small><small>s</small>ma<small>ll</small>e<small>s</small>t</small></sup> CyberDeck Build Yet, which coud have benefitted from a shorter Pi. 
He said so in his YouTube video.

<h3>How I cleaned a part of the world</h3>
<p><small>11th March, 2023</small><br/>
The entirety of my local Jubla had this weeks group hour together, because there was a small cleaning event. 
Think about it as a national clean-up day, but only for our Jubla. 
I was genuinely surprised by the amount of cigarettes my group found lying on the ground. 
I would say that we found between 25 and 50 used cigarettes.
If you multiply that number by four, which is the number of groups in my Jubla, we get 100 to 200 cigs found by everybody present. 
There seem to be a lot of smokers in this area. 
That is shocking to me, a person who never used nicotine. 
I actually almost used a vape, but then, instead of inhaling, I blew into it.
I need to go now, so see you tomorrow.<br/>

<h3>A romantic book taking place in the vietnam war</h3>
<p><small>10th March, 2023</small><br/>
As the title suggests, this blog post is about a romantic story taking place during the vietnam war. 
It will be written by my class, but we already discussed what we will write in the book. 
But you may ask, who is in the cast. 
Well, she is a vietnamese nurse living with her mother and sister (father is a soldier on the viet cong side) and he is a wounded american army guy. 
He first meets her in the hospital she works in and it is love at first sight because he is just too handsome, having blonde hair, green eyes and being athletic. 
Soon after, they kiss for the first time. 
Then, they fight because there is a war and they are on opposite sides of the war because of their nationalities (sorry, the fight is my fault). 
But then, they apologise because there is love. 
But when he first visits her home, her entire family disapproves of him. 
He needs to flee for ten days, but then she tells him to come back because she misses him. 
But then, he is surprised by her mother and he accidentally stabs her. 
The mother, not the girl. 
The sister sees this and calls the police and he needs to flee back to the army. 
His army boss tell him that he is very irresponsible and decides to bomb the hospital she works in. 
He tries to warn her by mail, but his boss intervenes by intercepting the mail. 
She does not know at all that her workplace is being bombed, and she dies. 
He commits suicide because his love is dead and the sister also commits suicide because her whole family is gone (except for her father, but he does not really count).
The end.<br/>
Thanks to Mr. Isotton for giving my class such an amazing idea!</p>

<h3>A good restart for my badminton skills</h3>
<p><small>9th March, 2023</small><br/>
A few years ago, I played a little badminton with my mother after school. 
I used to be pretty good at it. 
But then I stopped for some reason. 
But now, I started playing again as part of an optional subject. 
I did not want to go at all, but my mother insisted that I must go and play badminton. 
But it was not all badminton, a pretty big part of it was actually warm-up and a game to get to know each other better. 
We did not even have time to put the net up. 
If you know anything about badminton, then you should know that the net is one of the most important things in the game. 
But I think I have raged enough, so let me tell you a few facts about this racket sport. 
Badminton is played using a racket to hit a shuttlecock across a net. 
Today in badminton class, we used a line instead of a net. 
The most played forms of the game are so called "singles" and "doubles", with one and two players on each side of the net respectively. 
We only played the former. 
Points are scored by hitting the shuttlecock with the racket and making it hit the ground on the opposing side. 
The opponent wants it to fall on their opponents side, which is bad for you, so ideally, you should just play the shuttlecock over the net until one of you cannot do that anymore. 
I hope that this overview was good and i will (hopefully) write again tomorrow.<br/>
Thanks to my mother for giving me an idea for todays blog post!</p>

<h3>Which chess openings I play the most</h3>
<p><small>8th March, 2023</small><br/>
As you may or may not know, I play a lot of chess. 
I looked at all of the openings I played recently and listed them all. 
I prefer tactical openings, so I never play the london opening or anything similar. 
My favorite opening is the scandinavian defense. 
Now, here are the openings I play often.</p>
<dl>
<dt>King's Pawn Opening: Wayward Queen Attack</dt>
<dd>This one is one of my favorite openings. 
What I like about this one is that it confuses many beginners and makes them play the knights pawn a step forward, which allowes me to fork the king and the rook on the very next move. 
A much better response is playing one of the knights, either attacking the queen or defending the kings pawn, avoiding its capture. 
Another option for the opponent is the Kiddie Countergambit.<br/></dd>
<dt>Van't Kruijts Opening</dt>
<dd>When I do this, it is always by accident. 
But it sure does make the opponent play the kings pawn two squares. 
Then I swoop in with my queen, take the pawn and bait it.<br/></dd>
<dt>Scandinavian Defense</dt>
<dd>This is always what I play as black, without exception. 
It allowes me to get my queen out as quick as possible. 
The opponent usually responds by attacking my queen with the knight or with the Mieses Kotrč Variant. 
If he does the former, I just respond by moving my Queen a square left to check the king. 
I actually always do what my gut feeling tells me.<br/></dd>
<dt>Other Queen's Pawn Openings</dt>
<dd>I do not know at all why I played anything other than the Wayward Queen Attack, but I played them, so here they are, in no particular order:
<ul>
<li>Queen‘s Pawn Opening: Chigorin Variation</li>
<li>Queen‘s Pawn Opening: Anti-Torre Attack</li>
<li>Queen‘s Pawn Opening: 1…d5 2.e3 Nf6</li>
<li>Queen‘s Pawn Opening: Amazon Attack</li>
</ul><br/></dd>
<dt>Other Openings</dt>
<dd>I do not know at all why I played anything I don't know but here they are, again, in no particular order:
<ul>
<li>French Defense: Queen‘s Knight Variation</li>
<li>Grob Opening: Grob Gambit, 2…Bxg4</li>
<li>Pirc Defense</li>
<li>Réti Opening: Tennison Gambit</li>
<li>French Defense: King‘s Indian Attack</li>
</ul><br/></dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks to my opponents in chess for playing so diverse matches with me!</p>

<h3>A taste of India</h3>
<p><small>7th March, 2023</small><br/>
Today, we are starting with a new unit in english class. 
As the title of this blog post suggests, it is about India, the coutry I was born in. 
The english book has a few facts wrong, like the map, where Andhra Pradesh is shown in its state of before 2014, including Telangana. 
The book is from 2022. 
As you may or may not know, Andhra Pradesh is my birth state. 
Such a mistake makes me furious! 
A different mistake is that the book says, ninety-nine per cent of Indians have both a proper name and a nickname. 
The part with the proper name is probably correct, but there is no way that many Indians have a nickname.
I have a nickname, which is Chinnu, but none of my mothers indian friends have one. 
The authors may have done some research, but they have certainly not spoken with a real Indian, like they said in the book. 
On top of that, it said that Sri Lanka is a neighbouring country of India. 
It is an island! 
This book really is full of bullcrap.<br/>
Thanks to my english book for giving me a reason for writing this article!</p>

<h3>Why I deleted my Basic Tetris page</h3>
<p><small>6th March, 2023</small><br/>
Once upon a time, I had three pages: my main page, my contact page and my basic tetris page. 
Then, after reading an article about making money, I decided to make a blog. 
Actually, I am not making any money from the blog. 
I may in the future, though. 
Anyways, I had four pages. 
They all require maintenance. 
They are not all needed. 
Actually, on mobile, the navigation would show incorrectly because it was too tall. 
So, I decided to remove the least imporant one. 
And that happened to be the basic tetris page. 
I also asked my classmate if I should remove it, and he agreed to me.<br/>
Thanks to Mateo for giving me a little advice!</p>

<h3>At the Party</h3>
<p><small>4th March, 2023</small><br/>
Here we are now, listening to the song Taki Taki and watching a FIFA 23 match between two of my old classmates. 
Thanks to the convincing skills of the bithday boy Yassin and my mother, I am now allowed to sleep over here along with five other kids. 
The gifts were given to him and now, we are being sent to the playground by his mother.<br/>
Thanks to my mother for allowing me to sleep over at my best friends house!</p>

<h3>Happy Birthday to Yassin!</h3>
<p><small>4th March, 2023</small><br/>
Today is the birthday of my best friend, Yassin! 
So I felt the need to congratulate him in this plog post. 
There will be a bithday party at his place today for the duration of five hours, and it will surely be fun!
We will be grilling, swimming and doing a few other things. 
I may do a follow up post for after the party. 
Because the party and Jubla overlap, I, unfortunately, cannot go to Jubla. 
So sad, because I always used to show up at Jubla. 
For those who don't know what Jubla is, it is like boys/girls scout, but with more fun activities. 
I heard that boys/girls scout is everywhere, but Jubla is only in Switzerland.
There are 400 Jublas in the whole country, but some are only for girls for some reason.
Unlike boys/girls scout, Jubla is connected to the catholic church.
I think that explanation was good enough to understand what Jubla is. 
That is all I wanted to say now, so thank you for reading this post, dear reader!<br/>
Thanks to my best friend for hosting a cool bithday party!</p>

<h3>Things to do when you are bored (at home)</h3>
<p><small>3rd March, 2023</small><br/>
Do you know the feeling of when you are so bored, it feels like the most boring moment in your whole life? 
Well, you are in luck, because this blog post of mine should help you cope with those moments. 
Feel free to do the things in the following list!</p>
<dl>
<dt>Watch YouTube</dt>
<dd>It is the thing I do most when I am bored, and I am sure most of you do too. 
But since watching YouTube the whole time is bad for your eyes, I, of course, included other items in this list which may be more enjoyable for you.<br/></dd>
<dt>Play (video) games</dt>
<dd>This is something I used to do more in the past, but I eventually stopped since my parents got angry at me for playing online video games. 
There are games which are rather good for you, like chess, but the majority of games are bad, except for abselutely destroying boredom.<br/></dd>
<dt>Go outside for a walk</dt>
<dd>A not-so-obvious choice, is it? 
But it is a very real option, except there is a flood, blizzard, hurricane or tsunami going on outside your house right now. 
But then, you probably would not be able to read this plog post, so go ahead, do a walk and, most importantly, touch grass, if there is any outside your house. 
But, if you cannot for the aforementioned reasons, then good luck surviving that natural disaster. 
You need it!<br/></dd>
<dt>Do a little sports challenge</dt>
<dd>With this, I am not telling you to participate in an ultra marathon. 
I mean that nothing is stopping you from getting on the ground and seeing how many push ups you can do without stopping. 
I am pretty weak, so I am only able to do six, but you probably will be able to do more. 
Instead of push ups, you can also do russian twists, leg raises, sit ups, you name it!<br/></dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks to my boredom for giving me the idea to write this post!</p>

<h3>Worked myself up to 500 ELO in Chess.com today</h3>
<p><small>1st March, 2023</small><br/>
Yesterday, I still was at 400 ELO in Chess. 
But today, I worked myself up to 500 with patience and skill. 
Patience, since many of the matches I play result in wins solely for the fact that my opponents despawn for whatever reason and I need to wait until Chess.com acknowledges the fact that they are no longer present to finish playing the game.<br/>
Thanks to my bad opponents in Chess.com for being so easy to defeat!</p>

<h3>Started with Investing today</h3>
<p><small>28th February, 2023</small><br/>
Today, I wanted to start making some money. 
That is the reason why I opened YouTube and searched, how I could make money. 
Since a few videos gave me the suggestion to invest in Stonks, I continued to look into that topic. 
Actually, if done correctly, shares are like a bank account, but the interest actually generates a good amount of money. 
Otherwise, nobody would even think about investing into the stock market. 
In terms of riskiness, investing is like Linux. 
There is very safe stuff, a number of almost safe things and that little risk, which you probably should not even look at. 
Index funds (and fully tested distros like Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint and PopOS) are that very safe stuff, privately managed funds (and almost all Linux distros, there are too many to name but I have tested MX) are those number of almost safe things and normal stocks (and Arch Linux) are that little risk. 
If you cannot understand the sentence above, then let me inform you that you should always invest in index funds like S&P 500. 
Since you cannot beat the market, you should atleast go along with it.<br/>
Thanks to YouTube for informing me about Stonks!</p>

<h3>Why I didn't post for four days</h3>
<p><small>27th February, 2023</small><br/>
I did not publish anything for four days here and I felt the need to apologise for that. 
On Friday, I was busy with coming home from the skiing camp. 
In those hectic times, I preferred not to bother myself with writing a post for my blog. 
Since then, I was asked by my friends to meet them, and since they are my friends, I just went along with them. 
We did nothing too crazy like going to the Alpamare or anything like that. 
My parents would definitely not allow me to go there anyways because of the recent health and sanitary concerns from visitors. 
That did not stop friends of mine from going there, though. 
They probably did not read the news paper article on 20min, the news paper most of the visitors complained to. 
If they had complained to the management of the waterpark instead, it would probably be closed. 
The photos in the article looked pretty bad. 
Alpamare really needs a renovation, if it actually is called like that even for a non-necessary public facility.<br/>
Thanks to the visitors of Alpamare for informing the newspaper of the critical condition of the waterpark!</p>

<h3>Camp dinner</h3>
<p><small>23rd February, 2023 <b>Published two days late, sorry</b></small><br/>
In the morning, I ate bread with Nutella. 
Nothing too spectacular. 
For lunch, I ate a sandwich, an energy bar and a pack of peanuts. 
What is nothing short of spectacular is that for dinner, I got to eat Sp&Auml;tzli with vegetables. 
All thanks to the best cooking team my school had avalible. 
Not just this dinner, but all of the past five or so dinners were magnificent.<br/>
Thanks to the skiing camp cooking team for a week of extraordinary meals!</p>

<h3>The reason why I need to thank Miss Ganz again</h3>
<p><small>22nd February, 2023</small><br/>
Short answer is at the bottom of this blog post.<br/>
The long answer is here. 
Yesterday, we got to choose between sledging and discovering Scuol. 
The second option should have been ice skating, but it is too warm for that and fake ice does not exist yet. 
Because I prefer sledging, I chose the former option.<br/>
Today started a little different than usual. 
Instead of taking lunch with us, we were told that we would eat in the house and we were given a Getreideriegel. 
A few hours later, after skiing, we came back to the house and ate pizza, apple pie, garlic bread and Twix for lunch. 
We went sledging afterwards for around three hours. 
What I find confusing is that to go right, you need to apply pressure with the left foot and to go in the left direction, you need to ptess down with the right foot. 
Anyways, after finishing our sledging, instead of going back immediately, we did a small detour. 
Then, we stopped in front if the Volg.<br/>
The teacher said, we were allowed to choose one small item each and that she would pay for them. 
I chose a pack of chips(american, not british).<br/>
I think I thanked her enough, didn't I?</p>

<h3>We were allowed to ski alone</h3>
<p><small>21st February, 2023</small><br/>
Today, my luck was so low that I was woken up by those songs I mentioned in the last post. 
The rest of the morning was normal though. 
But instead of Chips and Twix, we got a pack of nuts and Knoppers. 
After eating lunch, one of the teachers had an announcement to make. 
<blockquote cite="Miss Ganz, translated from German to English">You are allowed to form groups of three. 
In those groups, you can ski around from 1 to 3 o'clock. 
You are not allowed to go in the fun park.</blockquote>
Yeah, I formed a group with those boys I mentioned yesterday, and we went off pist all the time. 
We wanted to go have fun in the fun park, but the stakes were too high. 
Besides, we had our own little off pist fun park which nobody else used. 
Not to forget the bumpy rides! 
Last time I saw them, my friend almost broke his ankle. 
But now, it looks like there are a few difficulties. 
And I, of course, chose the easiest one.<br/>
Thanks to Miss Ganz for giving us some freedom!</p>

<h3>Lost one of my Gloves today</h3>
<p><small>20th February, 2023</small><br/>
Today started like the next three or four days probably will. 
One of my roommates woke all of us up today, then one of the teachers blasted some straight up bad songs to wake the others up and to call for us to come to eat breakfast. 
Breakfast today was like a buffet with bread, cornflakes and milk with Nutella and butter being on each table. 
After that, we got our lunches consisting of sandwiches, chips, a swiss version of Twix, and apples/clementines. 
Then we got our skiing stuff, got into the shuttle bus and the gondola and went skiing. 
A few hours later, we went onto a terrace by the upper station of the gondola and ate our lunches there. 
At least me, the guys from the other boys room, and two girls did so. 
I have no clue where the others ate lunch. 
Maybe it happened there, maybe after we left the table. 
Either way, I am missing an expensive skiing glove. 
If you are in Scoul right now and found a right gore-tex skiing glove, please inform me as soon as possible via my contact formula. 
For the next few days, I have to use the gloves my teacher gave me.<br/>
Thanks to Mr. Isotton for lending me a pair of gloves!</p>

<h3>Messed up our Room already</h3>
<p><small>19th February, 2023</small><br/>
Today, we arrived and were skiing a little in Scuol. 
We were asked who we want to share a room with, and I chose three guys. 
One of them addad a different guy to his list, and because the teachers wanted to make us all as happy as possible, we were all put in one room. 
A few temporary roommates of mine brought a few snacks, including Drinks like Coca Cola, and spilled a little in the room. 
There would probably be a hefty fine. 
Probably, because of these two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not snitching on the person who did it</li>
<li>They propably will not make a fine because they don't know who did it</li>
</ul>
<p>This is getting long, so bye, I guess.<br/>
Thanks to Miss Ganz for making me stay in the same room as my friends!</p>

<h3>Discovered Wordle Variants today</h3>
<p><small>18th February, 2023</small><br/>
Two posts ago, I wrote that I got to know Wordle. 
Because I watched Triple S Games' Videos on Symble, Hurdle and Quordle, I got interested in those variations and started playing them. 
But at the same time, I am really pissed by the difficulty. 
Today, I almost solved todays Symble, but instead of writing K as the second letter of my last guess, I wrote H! 
I guess I am like the average gamer, liking a game but also being mad because it is so difficult. 
In my opinion, Quordle is the hardest of the four, because you need to play four Wordles in one game with a measly nine guesses. 
Everybody should try all four of them in my opinion. But watch Triple S Games' tutorials before you do the former. <br/>
Thanks to Triple S Games for making tutorials on Wordles variants!<p>

<h3>Hyped for my skiing camp</h3>
<p><small>17th February, 2023 <b>i</b></small><br/>
From the day after tomorrow until next Friday, I am going to be in a skiing camp hosted by my school.
For that, I had to drop my suitcase off at school today, so that the father of my english teacher could load it into his trailer.
In the camp, we will go sledging, ice skating, and of course skiing. 
Since I am not allowed to take any electronic devices there, my phone being the only exception, I will not be posting from Monday to Thursday. 
On Sunday, my dad will sponsor a post, which is easier than coming up with a new post from scratch, and on Friday, I may post a picture or two. 
Oh, and by the way, even after the camp, I may not post daily anymore. 
That is because my blog needed a little jumpstart in the early beginning, but now it doesn't need it anymore. 
My new schedule may be once a week or twice a month from now on. Anyway, this post is getting a little long, so goodbye and see you in the next post. <br/>
Thanks to the father of my english teacher for driving our luggage!</p>

<h3>My Thoughts on the Earthquake in Turkiye and Syria</h3>
<p><small>16th February, 2023</small><br/>
The earthquake, which took place in southern Turkiye on the 6th of February, is a horrendous tragedy. 
But while the affected areas in Turkiye are getting a fair amount of support, equally affected areas in neighboring Syria are getting little to no aid at all, since the borders are closed. 
Luckily, there are people like my dentist, who are forwarding donations directly to the affected people in Syria. <br/>
By the way, if you want to donate, here are a few donation links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kizilay.org.tr/Bagis/BagisYap/405/donations-for-earthquake-in-pazarcik">Turkish Red Crescent(Kizilay)</a></li>

<h3>Started playing Wordle and Sudoku</h3>
<p><small>15th February, 2023</small><br/>
Some time ago, my dad started playing Wordle online and Sudoku in an app, and I enjoyed helping him with solving them.
Now, I want to play Wordle and Sudoku daily. Actually, the battery of my phone depleted today while I was playing a few Sudoku(s) in the App from Easybrain.
Additionally, I am in a Whatsapp group chat named Wordle, alongside my dad, my uncle and my granddad. I really enjoy playing those Games. 
Now, if you will excuse me, I want to go back to playing Sudoku.<br/>

<h3>Happy International Day of Self Love!</h3>
<p><small>14th February, 2023 <b>Sponsored by my mom</b></small><br/>
It's Valentine's day, but it is also #internationaldayofselflove.
<br/>
A reminder to all of us people to cut yourself some slack and out ourselves first for a change.
<br/>
As Michelle Obama said - "Over the years I’ve recognized something important: Whether it was going to the gym at the crack of dawn or finding an extra moment to unwind in 
my favorite chair, in order for me to be at my best for others around me, I needed to find some time for myself."
<br/>
So today be your own valentine (as corny as it sounds) and spend some time saying NO to others and saying YES to yourself.
<br/>
Agree ? <br/>
Thanks to my Mom for sponsoring this post!</p>

<h3>Shoutout to Washo</h3>

Not too long ago, there was a sponsored post in 20min, a free news paper which probably earns it's money with sponsored posts. 
That day's sponsored post was from a company called Washo, which makes washing strips, which is supposed to replace washing mashine liquid, if I understand it correctly.
On the online version of the news paper, there was even an affilliate link, that led me to a website, which shipped free samples to me!
Without hesitation I ordered samples of all four fragrances and they all arrived today.<br/>
Thanks to Washo for sending me four samples!</p>
