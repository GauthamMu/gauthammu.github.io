				<h1>Gautham's new hobby page</h1>
				<p>Hello and welcome to my new hobby page, which I made myself in my informatics apprenticeship using HTML and CSS. I am making this because I have too many things in the table row on the homepage, but too less explanaition.</p>
				<h2>Web developement</h2>
				<p>That is the thing I am doing right now. It consists of writing in HTML, CSS and JavaSript.</p>
				<h3>HTML</h3>
				<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. That is supposed to mean that HTML is not a programming language, but instead a language for displaying things on the web. HTML file names end with either html or htm.</p>
				<h3>CSS</h3>
				<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. That is supposed to mean that in CSS, the properties of the parent element are taken over by the child. That means that you can give the parent the property to automatically give it to the child too. CSS file names end with css.</p>
				<h3>JavaScript</h3>
				<p>Unlike the name suggests, JavaScript and Java are totally different. JavaScript is actually called ECMAScript. JavaScript is the language to actually code in the web. JavaScript file names end with js.</p>
				<h2>Jubla</h2>
				<p>Jubla is an Organization like Scout. There are groups seperated by age and gender. (bruh, thats kinda sexist (;-))) I got something to say. Both my crush and I are in the Jubla. She is in the oldest female group, I am in the male one. And just recently, a fellow 'Jublanian' (these are not supposed to be sus quotes) shared her adress with me, which is (sum streetname not mentioned because privacy)strasse 69. It may be that he is telling me the truth, but how how many friends do you have who live in a house with the house number being that funny? Plus, I looked all over that street, and did not find a single indication of there being a house number 69 tthere. Even Google Maps tells me that I am at my destination when I was in front of house number 71. The only logical explanaition is that he, indeed, lied to me. It may also be, that she lied to him when she told him that adress. If you can tell me if the address is true or not, please contact me on the contact site of my website proper. There is a link on my oldschool homepage. You can also tell me what you think about this set of webpages there. If you want to know more about Jubla, please seek the official site of the organization. There is more accurate information than here. 
					<br/><br/> Hey, it's new Gautham Mudunuru here. Old me was really stupid, if he really tried to stalk his crush that hard. Now I definitely know that that is very wrong to do, and I definitely know why she hates me. I should probably apologise to her the next time I see her. </p>
				<h2>Reading books</h2>
				<p>Do you also like reading? I like to read SPY (Arno Strobel), Ein Fall für Kwiatkowski (Jürgen Banscherus (He actually came to my school to read a part of one of his books to us, I only like Ein Fall für Kwiatkowski tho)) and others. I do not do it as much as in the past, though. I watch YouTube more than anything. If, however, there was a power outage, I would love to read a book. But the home of my family will be powered by some solar panels and some huge batteries in the future, so that will not ever be expected.</p>
				<h2>Playing</h2>
				<p>I also do not do this anymore. Maybe I would be down to play Football, or Soccer for all the American losers out there, but definitely not Cricket. I am also not in a club or anything.</p>
				<h2>Hiking and Skiing</h2>
				<p>To be honest, I only do it because my parents basically force me to do it. By the way, did you know that I one did a backflip on Skis? Anyway, there are no more informations in this section.</p>
				<h2>Games</h2>
				<p>Just like a big part of the population out there, I love games. Unfortunately, I am only allowed to play Stumble Guys on my phone, and my laptop is massively underpowered to play proper games (i3-Dual-Core-Processor from the 11th Generation) so even on my laptop, I only play things like paper.io and agar.io. If you know any better games which can run on my laptop, please let me know. Anyway, here are some infos about the games I play.</p>
				<h3>Paper.io</h3>
				<p>Imagine a snake, which always gets longer. That snake does not actually move, the head of it just gets extended. If anything, including the snake itself, runs into its tail, it dies. But there a safe circle, where it is allowed to run into its tail. It starts in the middle of the safe circle and ollows the cursor of the computer mouse, or the finger on mobile devices. If it goes out of the safe circle and back in, the area between the safe circle and the tail becomes a part of the safe circle, making the safe circle bigger. The snake can run into the safe circles of other players, making the captured area part of the capturing players safe circle. You win if you capture the entire area of the map, which is circular.</p>
				<h3>Stumble Guys</h3>
				<p>It is like Fall Guys, but on the phone. I am pretty sure that there is a website out there on the web explaining Fall Guys. On top of that, I am tired from explaining Paper.io, so please, do not make me explain Stumble Guys.</p>
				<h3>Agar.io</h3>
				<p>I also do not want to explain Agar.io, but here you go. Agar.io is a game where the aim is to become the biggest circle in the map. You accomplish that by eating random tiny NPC cirlces, which don't move and randomly spawn on the map. You can also eat non-NPC circles, as long as they are smaller than your circle. But smaller circles are marginally faster than smaller ones. Cilcles of the same size cannot eat each other. Now please leave me alone or give me advice for my crush or some maad rizz.</p>
