            <h2>Welcome to My Hobby Page</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my new hobby page, where I'll share my interests and hobbies that I've been exploring during my informatics apprenticeship using HTML and CSS.</p>
            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>One of my passions is web development. Through the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy creating digital spaces that come to life with interactivity and style. Building websites allows me to bring my creativity to the online world, where I can design captivating user experiences and solve real-world problems through code.</p>
            <h3>Jubla</h3>
            <p>Jubla, an organization akin to Scouts, provides me with exciting adventures and opportunities for personal growth. Engaging in various activities alongside friends and fellow enthusiasts lets me learn new skills, develop leadership qualities, and foster connections with diverse individuals. Whether it's outdoor adventures, team challenges, or skill-building workshops, Jubla offers a vibrant platform for me to explore, lead, and thrive.</p>
            <h3>Reading Books</h3>
            <p>There's something magical about immersing myself in the pages of a book. I find solace, knowledge, and inspiration within the written word. The thrill of discovering new worlds, meeting intriguing characters, and unraveling complex plots captivates me. Reading allows me to expand my horizons, enhance my vocabulary, and develop a deeper understanding of human emotions and experiences.</p>
            <h3>Playing</h3>
            <p>Engaging in sports isn't just about the physical activity; it's an avenue for personal growth, teamwork, and enjoyment. I relish the moments spent on the field, be it football or soccer, where I build endurance, refine my skills, and experience the exhilaration of friendly competition. Sports foster discipline, camaraderie, and the joy of achieving common goals with my teammates.</p>
            <h3>Hiking and Skiing</h3>
            <p>Nature's beauty beckons me to explore its wonders through hiking and skiing. While I might not be the most enthusiastic participant, I appreciate the tranquility and thrill of outdoor adventures. Hiking allows me to reconnect with the natural world, discover breathtaking landscapes, and challenge my physical limits. Skiing, with its blend of speed and technique, provides a rush of excitement as I navigate snow-covered slopes.</p>
            <h3>Games</h3>
            <p>Games offer a realm of entertainment and mental engagement. I'm drawn to the strategic challenges presented by games like Paper.io, where I navigate and expand my territory while avoiding obstacles and opponents. Stumble Guys provides a fun and light-hearted experience that keeps me entertained and connected with friends. Agar.io, with its simple yet captivating concept, challenges me to grow and dominate while avoiding larger adversaries.</p>
